## Apple-project

So one of the projects that i worked on was the very frist Iphone. Me and Steve Jobs had a lot of complication on the design for the device i thought a sharp and Square style would be very simple and might be a nice look for the frist Iphone. He said that was good idea but what if we rounded of the corners to make more sleek in design that would not hurt thr use.

## Microsoft

Another one of my prjects that i worked on was with microsoft and design the Xbox360 which i also helped in the back ground. help design Halo 3 the game. The microsoft team wanted a cheap console and a way for it to be manufacturted quickly and efficently. So i suggest that we get a big software company that could produce thousands of motherboards in a day so that we as a company can popular demands and not fall behind our competitors. Little to say they loved the idea.

## Samsung

When i worked for samsung i help them create their plasma tv's.
