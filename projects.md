So one of the projects that i worked on was the very frist Iphone. Me and Steve Jobs had a lot of complication on the design for the device i thought a sharp and Square style would be very simple and might be a nice look for the frist Iphone. He said that was good idea but what if we rounded of the corners to make more sleek in design that would not hurt thr use.
